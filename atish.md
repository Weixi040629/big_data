Atish was born in Chicago but lives in North Carolina right now. He is 16 years old and is going into his senior next year.

Atish enjoys drawing, playing video games, and listening to music, just to name a few! Atish has watched Bojack Horseman and played games such as Team Fortress 2 and Devil May Cry 5.

Atish's favorite class was his Honors Physics class from his sophomore year, he really enjoyed it because his teacher Mr. Curtin was so great. 

Atish's goals for this class are to take away some skills that he can apply to his major in college and potentially his job in the future.

Atish thinks that shows from the 2000s are better than shows from 2010s.(Aidan agrees!)
